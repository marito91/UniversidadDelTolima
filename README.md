# University Grading System

This repository contains a University based, grading system. Using Python on the backend side of the project and HTML/CSS for the frontend side, this website lets different types of users benefit from it. 

The types of users that can benefit are the following:
- Admin
- Teacher
- Student

If you download the raw DB file (which is done in SQL) you're going to find login info for the users.
